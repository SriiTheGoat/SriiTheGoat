👋 Hi, I’m Srijan (@SriiTheGoat).

👀 I’m interested in web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For backend development, I use Node.js and occasionally Java.

🌱 I’m currently learning more about Node.js to enhance my backend development skills.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting web development projects that push the boundaries of creativity and innovation.

⚡ Fun fact: I love football, and the rivalry between Cristiano Ronaldo (CR7) and Lionel Messi is something I find fascinating. I'm particularly inspired by CR7's work ethic and dedication to excellence. Apart from football, I enjoy reading books and maintaining an active lifestyle through exercise. I've also had the opportunity to compete at the national level in football, which has been an incredible experience.
